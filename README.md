# Mission_To_Mars
This project utilizes websrcapping to collect data from NASA sites and store and analyze them through MongoDB. I used splinter and beautiful soup to do the webscrapping in Jupyter Notebook and then imported the file into VS Code. From there, I refactored the code, created a flask app, and an HTML CSS file. With these three files and a MongoDB file, I was able to pull the scraped data into my own webpage and present a summary of news published by NASA's Mars website.
